If you see hundreds of coastguards moving towards you, get out of the way or walk in the opposite direction. Do not start running in order to avoid stampedes and the risk of being arrested.
If you see protesters damaging or stealing property, move away from the scene immediately. Otherwise you risk reprisals from coastguard troops or arrest.</description></item></channel></rss>
