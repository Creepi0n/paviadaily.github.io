<em>The first public Pumpkin Pie Station in Pavia City /AHRIMANNE</em></p><p>Away from the trench warfare of national politics, the newly elected mayor of Pavia, Ahrimanne, has launched a city-wide initiative to combat ‘hunger, malnutrition and widespread vitamin deficiencies’.</p><p>This evening, the first pumpkin pie station of the new campaign was opened without a major press conference at the junction of MG Square and the west entrance to the town hall. Faced with the highly controversial issue of the public budget, Ahri preemptively responded that it would only cost the city half an iron bar per serving. For the time being, this would include a ‘16-pie meal kit’, with the possibility of increasing these portions in the near future.</p><p>He would be very concerned about the lack of food for many Pavian citizens, as well as immigrant newfriends, it would no longer be just ‘stale bread or frozen potatoes shipped from who knows where’ an option for the poorest.</p><p>The new station, which was equipped with a five-minute cooldown per person to prevent fraud, was received with great joy by the Pavian public. Ordinary citizens as well as nobles and dukes were delighted and immediately went to get a slice of pumpkin pie.</p><p>Even though His Majesty’s government is incapable of conducting competent and meaningful politics for Pavia and its subjects, there are still some local politicians who stand up for the country.</p></main><section class="article-meta article-footer"><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Christopher Eepion is the Editor-in-chief and journalist at Pavia Daily.
