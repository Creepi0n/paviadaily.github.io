<em>Prime Minister Cissonius announcing his resignation to the public and press earlier today. /C. EEPION</em></p><p>In a surprising turn of events, Cissonius (Pavia First) has today announced his immediate resignation from the post of Prime Minister, a development that has surprised many political pundits and the reasoning is nothing short of curious.</p><p>In an event announced to the press, former Prime Minister Cissonius announced that he had dreamt last night about Braemari sheep and their ‘soft wool’ and ‘reassuring presence’. This dream led him to resign as Prime Minister and call a snap election for this weekend. Cissonius himself would now retire to the islands of Braemar and pursue his sheep farming.</p><p>Only a few hours later, the office of Emperor Seekinq I published a press release regarding the new elections. In it, the Emperor thanked Cissonius for his more than two months of dedicated leadership of the country and wished him all the best for his return to Braemar. In view of the upcoming elections, the Emperor emphasised the importance of citizen participation and encouraged all eligible citizens to cast their vote. He expressed his wish for an election season characterised by lively debate and respectful discourse, with a shared commitment to the common good and the future of the realm.</p><p>The opposition did not rest on its laurels either and Renew released a new election campaign this evening. As part of this press release, Renew announced that ArtificialDriver had been nominated as a candidate for Prime Minister. The party would recognise and respect ArtificialDriver’s contributions to the country despite recent differences. Renew faces major challenges in the face of a looming economic crisis in Pavia and wants to prevent extreme right-wing forces from destabilising the country. As part of an internal reorganisation, BritishWanderer was appointed as the new party leader. The plan is to continue the work of the previous legislative period and correct some controversial decisions made by the previous government.</p><p>Renew is not the only party to announce interest in competing for the office of Prime Minister. UPP, led by party chairman Gobblin, and the newly founded AMP (Alliance for Mutual Progress) have also announced their entrance into the election for the highest elected political office in the state. The latter, founded by CedarValiant and PaddingtonBear, is set to pick up where the similar-sounding previous “AMP” had left off.</p><p>Despite this surprise of a sudden election, it is clear that no political actor has been unprepared for something like this to happen. Maybe rumor spread already around early this week whether a resignation might soon happen or not.</p><p>Regardless, Pavia Daily will be presenting all the Prime Minister candidates to our readers and give a quick overview of their political positions and believes.</p></main><section class="article-meta article-footer"><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Christopher Eepion is the Editor-in-chief and journalist at Pavia Daily.
