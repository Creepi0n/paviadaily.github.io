<em>Prime Minister Cissonius announcing the controversial decrees. /CHRISTINA ONNIUS (HRM GOVERNMENT)</em></p><p>In an unexpected announcement, Prime Minister Cissonius has launched two new decrees. They are intended to fill the state coffers and bring more immigrants into the city, but many see this political shift by Pavia First as opportunistic and extremely dangerous.</p><p>Major entrepreneurs, philanthropists and members of the opposition reacted with shock. Only a few minutes after the announcement, Renew - a coalition partner in the current cabinet - published a press release. Renew party leader ArtificialDriver and party colleague BritishWanderer sharply criticised these recent policies by Pavia First, including a 27.5% tax on Monument Group’s quarterly net income and the removal of citizenship price caps. BritishWanderer condemned the government’s handling of finances, likening the situation to a catastrophic flood and suggesting that the coalition agreement with Pavia First should be reconsidered. ArtificialDriver also criticised the policy, particularly the lack of consultation with the Chamber of Commerce, and expressed concern about the potential economic impact, even if this was limited for other companies such as Artificial Industries.</p><p>A number of nobles - including the Prime Minister - are said to have met in the Imperial Council chambers late today, arguing vociferously about His Majesty’s Government’s new policies. A discussion between the Head of the Bureau of Architecture and the Premier Minister about the budget allocation is said to have degenerated to such an extent that publicly accessible parts of the Town Hall had to be closed off.</p><p>In light of the ongoing protests in Windermere, many feel the newly passed legislation is in poor taste and a kick in the face to those who helped build our city. Soon after the news broke, a protest of concerned citizens gathered outside the town hall to express their displeasure. Many of those we spoke to expressed their discomfort at living with more and more dual citizens. A disproportionate amount of housing is already in the hands of foreign nationals who do not live in it and let it fall into disrepair. The protesters fear that this situation will only get worse from now on. Some even wondering if Monument Group would stay in the city with these enormous new taxes. “They take all the money away from the companies, and then they use it to build these “CUB” train lines, bringing all these people here&mldr; And now they still take more, you know who they’ll take from next? From us poor lads!”, an older gentleman from Highgrove complained.</p><p>Experts fear that this relaxation of dual citizenship could sooner or later lead to simplified naturalisation to full citizenship. According to calculations, a foreign, anti-Pavian organisation would have had to spend a maximum of 640 diamonds to influence the mayoral election in its favour.</p><p>This new weakening of regulations will sooner or later be felt in every neighbourhood of the city, as well as the entire country. It remains to be seen what the short and long term consequences of today’s developments will be.</p></main><section class="article-meta article-footer"><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Christopher Eepion is the Editor-in-chief and journalist at Pavia Daily.
