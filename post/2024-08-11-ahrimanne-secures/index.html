<em>Mayor Ahri celebrating in front of a crowd of supporters his close victory. /PATRICK ÀGGF</em></p><p>A few minutes ago, the Office of the State Tabulator announced the results of the first election for mayor of Pavia. As expected by the polls, Ahri was able to acclaim victory, but with a much smaller majority than hoped for.</p><p>As the campaign team around Ahrimanne had expected a stronger majority, this election result came as a big surprise to them.
Exit polls suggest that Cedar’s “little man” strategy worked and that a large, silent group of voters - who had not previously made themselves known - did turn out to vote this weekend.</p><p>After the results were announced, Ahri gave a short victory speech at his election rally in front of the town hall. The electorate had shown today that anyone - even an admin - can make it in Pavia and that “today we have destroyed the highest and hardest of glass ceilings”. He was now on his way to meet Emperor Seekinq and thanked all those who had entrusted him with their vote. Shortly afterwards, Cedar congratulated Ahri on his victory.</p><p>When asked if the candidates would like to comment on the election results in more detail, Cedar declined to comment and Ahri stated that he was proud of his team and what they had achieved so far. He said he was touched and humbled by the support he had received from the people. The Prime Minister commented that Ahrimanne was wished all the best in his new role as mayor. He was satisfied that the MOELI Act would have allowed citizens to vote democratically and that the best candidate in their opinion will serve the city. His government will work with Ahri to realise his vision for Pavia city.</p><p>Despite much public campaigning by His Majesty’s Government, only 26% of all eligible voters - of whom a large proportion were nobles according to post-election surveys - exercised their right to vote. These figures strongly indicate that the majority of the population has little or no interest in political participation. Critics of the mayoral election feel strengthened in their assumption that the average citizen is unable to understand the complexity of the political landscape. It would show once again that the vote of the nobility was the decisive factor in this election, despite the right to vote for common citizens.</p><p>The coming days and weeks will now be decisive in determining whether Ahri can fulfil his promises as mayor. Political opponents were already worried before the election Ahri had put too many issues on his plate and will not be able to deliver on them all. When asked about this Ahri only commented that &ldquo;with the citizens&rsquo; backing, anything we set our mind to is possible&rdquo;.</p><p>Pavia Daily will continue with its political coverage in the following days and weeks ahead and wish Ahri all the best for their term as the first Mayor of Pavia.</p></main><nav class=post-nav><span class=nav-prev><a href=/post/2024-08-12-pudding-lane/>&larr; Pudding Lane Violence Continues</a></span>
