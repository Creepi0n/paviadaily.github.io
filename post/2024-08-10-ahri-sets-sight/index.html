<em>Pavians from all social classes and demographic background are still in line at the voting stations. /C. EEPION</em></p><p>While the first mayoral election for the city of Pavia is still ongoing, Pavia Daily sought insights from the candidates on their chances and the impact of the recent debate.</p><p>Ahri, who secured 77% of the post-debate vote, expressed cautious optimism. While pleased with the debate’s outcome, Ahri noted that the low viewership, due to its timing and restricted channel access, might limit its influence on the broader electorate. Nonetheless, Ahri believes that the campaign’s consistent messaging and recent positive interactions with voters, such as the support for a new gay pub in Pavia, will drive a favorable election result.</p><p>On the other hand, Cedar, who has struggled to gain traction, took a more subdued stance. “I’ve been honored to be part of this process, but I’m aware of the challenges we face,” Cedar acknowledged. “The debate was an opportunity to present our ideas, but I’m not sure it was enough to sway the voters in our favor. I don’t have high expectations for a win, but I remain committed to serving the people of Pavia, regardless of the outcome.”</p><p>With Ahri’s confidence and Cedar’s subdued outlook, the city of Pavia awaits the final results of this historic race.</p><p>As the election continues, the contrasting responses from Ahri and Cedar highlight the differing strategies and outlooks in this historic race. Ahri’s confidence and detailed engagement stand in stark contrast to Cedar’s brief and uncertain comments, leaving the city of Pavia eagerly awaiting the final results.</p></main><section class="article-meta article-footer"><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Christopher Eepion is the Editor-in-chief and journalist at Pavia Daily.
